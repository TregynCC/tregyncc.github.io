Hi, my name is **Chen Cui (崔晨)**. I will begin my Ph.D. studies in Economics at **The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen** in September 2026. I received my B.A. in Economics from **University of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences**, and my M.Sc. in Economics from **The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen**. My research interests are primarily in pure and applied microeconomic theory.
